# Ruby Backend Engineer Code Exercise

Code quality is very important to us.

We're sending you this challenge so that we can evaluate your coding skills and knowledge in Ruby.

## What we expect to see in your solution

- Adherence to Ruby's conventions and idioms
- Clean code
- Consistent style
- Extensibility
- Maintainability
- Object-oriented
- Testability

# The challenge

- Read/parse data represented in different formats

  Find a sample of each format in [spec/fixtures](spec/fixtures)

- Order the data by `first_name`

- Format each entry to `<first_name>, <city>, <birth_date M/D/YYYY>`

- Write at least 2 specs, but no more than 5 - we don't expect 100% coverage

### Notes

- Create as many files/classes as you need
- Use anything you need from Ruby standard library
- Don't use any gem to accomplish the solution
- Don't worry about invalid input data

# Instructions

1. Clone the repository and run `bundle install`

2. Run `bundle exec rspec`

   Notice that there is one functional test failing

3. Create a branch to work on the solution

4. Write code and unit tests until the functional test at [spec/functional/app_spec.rb](spec/functional/app_spec.rb) becomes green

5. Push your branch and create a pull request on GitHub
